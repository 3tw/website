## Countries comparison

- starting index / X value should be 0, but it's not
    - this is because of the centered moving averages
    - we need to calculate the averages before filtering
- logarithmic scale should use a different starting mode
    1 / 1M
    - something is wrong with the starting X on log scale
    - something is wrong with Swiss data
- dodaj vir podatkov spodaj
- add more country sets
    - kritične države (svet)
- show dates in tooltips
- add other metrics - which ones?
- add disclaimer
