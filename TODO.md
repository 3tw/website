## Remember range selection

- implement an event handler that records button which was selected and
    stores it to the chart state
    - https://api.highcharts.com/highstock/rangeSelector.buttons.events
- then render that state to `selected`
- https://api.highcharts.com/highstock/rangeSelector
- `selected`: The index of the button to appear pre-selected.
